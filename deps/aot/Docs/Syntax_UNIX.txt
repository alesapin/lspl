This is a program for shallow syntax anlaysis (Russian and German languages).

This program is distributed under the Library GNU Public Licence, which is in the file
COPYING.  

This program was  written by Dmitry Pankratov, Igor Nozhov, Lev Gershenzon, 
Alexey Sokirko.  The project started in Moscow in Dialing 
Company (Russian Language). The German part was created  
at Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities in  Berlin (the project DWDS). 


The system has been developed under Windows 2000 (MS VS 6.0), but
has also been compiled and run under Linux(GCC).  It should work with
minor changes on other systems.

Website of DDC: www.aot.ru, www.dwds.de

I compiled all sources with gcc 3.2. Lower versions are not supported.


The project uses a regular expression library "PCRE" (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions).
We test compilation only with version 6.4. Other versions were not tested. 
One should download this version  from the official site and install it 
to the default place. If you do not want to install it or you do not have enough
rights to do it, then you should  create two environment variables: 
	1.  RML_PCRE_LIB, that  points to PCRE library directory, where
libpcre.a and libpcrecpp.a should be located, for example:
	export RML_PCRE_LIB=~/RML/contrib/pcre-6.4/.libs
    2  RML_PCRE_INCLUDE, that points to PCRE include catalog, 
where "pcrecpp.h" is located, for example
    export RML_PCRE_INCLUDE=~/RML/contrib/pcre-6.4




=================================================
====== 					 Installation       =====
=================================================


Unpacking

* Create  a catalog and  register a system variable RML, which  points 
to this catalog:
	mkdir /home/sokirko/RML
	export  RML=/home/sokirko/RML

* Put "synan.tar.gz", "graphan_dicts.tar.gz",  "???-src-morph.tar.gz",
"???-syn-dicts.tar.gz" to this catalog, "???" can be "rus" or "ger", 
according to what you have downloaded. Unpack it 
 	tar xfz synan.tar.gz
	tar xfz graphan_dicts.tar.gz
	tar xfz ???-src-morph.tar.gz
	tar xfz ???-syn-dicts.tar.gz



Compiling morphology

  1.  cd $RML
	

  2.   ./compile_morph.sh  
      This step should create all libraries and a test program $RML\Bin\TestLem.

  3.   ./generate_morph_bin.sh <lang>
     where <lang> can be Russian, German according to the dictionary
    yo have  downloaded.

  The script should terminate with message "Everything is OK". 
  You can test the morphology 
	$RML\Bin\TestLem <lang>


Compiling Syntax

1.  cd $RML

2. ./compile_synan.sh 
   This script should build $RML/Bin/TestSynan




Building Graphematics dicts

1.  cd $RML

2. ./gen_graphan_bin.sh <lang>
   This script should build $RML/Bin/TestSynan
     where <lang> can be Russian, German according to the dictionary
    yo have  downloaded.


Building Synan dicts

1.  cd $RML

3. ./generate_syn_bin.sh  <lang>
     where <lang> can be Russian, German according to the dictionary
    yo have  downloaded.
   This script should build $RML/Bin/TestSynan, a command line program which 
you can use to test syntax.


Each script should output "Everything is OK", otherwise something is wrong,
so you can write me (sokirko@yandex.ru)
